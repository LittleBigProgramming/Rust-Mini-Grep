# Rust-Mini-Grep

Small CLI application to grep a line containing a word input as the first argument of the application from a file, which is entered as the second arguement. With basic error handling.  

Currently the application has basic Cargo test(s) and can return lines from the `poem.txt` included in the repository. 

An example of this would be running `cargo run frog poem.txt` would return `How public, like a frog`. 

*The point of the application is too learn the basics of Rust.*
